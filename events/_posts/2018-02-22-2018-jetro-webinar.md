### Webinar on JETRO Survey

On February 22, SelectUSA will host the Survey of Japanese Manufacturers in the United States in conjunction with the Japan External Trade Organization (JETRO). The free webinar will share the results of JETRO's annual survey of Japanese manufacturers in the United States. 

This information will help U.S. economic developers to understand the Japanese perspective on current and future business conditions in the United States. 

Topics will include:

* How do Japanese manufacturers perceive their prospects in the U.S. market?
* What are the main considerations to business expansion in the United States?
* What factors do Japanese firms take into account when relocating and expanding to new states?
