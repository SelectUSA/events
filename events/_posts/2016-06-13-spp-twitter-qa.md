### Twitter Q&A with Secretary Penny Pritzker

Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker will hold a “reverse Twitter Q&A” the week before the 2016 SelectUSA Investment Summit, June 13-17. Each day at 1:00 p.m., she will tweet a question for Summit exhibitors and attendees and then retweet many of the answers. This is a great opportunity to highlight your organization to the Secretary’s 47,000 Twitter followers. Remember to use the hashtag #SelectUSASummit in your answers!

Questions include:

* **Monday:** _#SelectUSASummit exhibitors, what’s a surprising fact about your U.S. state, community, or region?_
* **Tuesday** _Returning attendees, what advice would you give to #econdev organizations new to the #SelectUSASummit?_
* **Wednesday** _What #SelectUSASummit speaker/panel (besides @POTUS) are you most excited for? http://selectusasummit.us/agenda-at-a-glance/_
* **Thursday** _How is the #SelectUSASummit theme of #innovation important to your company or US community?_
* **Friday** _#SelectUSASummit exhibitors, what's the best reason for participants to visit your booth on Monday?_
