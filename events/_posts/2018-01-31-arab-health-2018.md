Did you know that countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) - Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE - constitute the United States' fifth-largest export market? GCC member countries are also responsible for $43 billion of foreign direct investment to the United States, responsible for 39,300 U.S. jobs. The UAE alone accounts for the largest share of investment from GCC countries: $26.3 billion (and rapidly growing).
