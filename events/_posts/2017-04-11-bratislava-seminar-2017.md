### SelectUSA Seminar in Bratislava, Slovakia

On April 11, 2017, the U.S. Commercial Service at the U.S. Embassy in Bratislava, Slovakia will team up with SelectUSA and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to host a seminar on how Slovak firms can enter and expand in the United States.

The event will focus on the legal, accounting, insurance, and financial considerations related to doing business in the United States. In addition, through the presentation of case studies and one-on-one meetings with our partners, participants will gain first-hand insight into the U.S. market.

The program includes panel discussions on:

* Practical aspects of initiating your business in the U.S. including questions relating to U.S. visas
* Accessing finance and other funding opportunities
* Testimonials by Slovak companies that have successfully expanded to the U.S.
* Information, including registration, on the upcoming [2017 SelectUSA Investment Summit](http://www.selectusasummit.us/)
