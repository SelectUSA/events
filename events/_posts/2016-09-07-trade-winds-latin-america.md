### Trade Winds—Latin America Business Forum

The [Trade Winds-Latin America Business Development Conference and Trade Mission](http://2016.export.gov/tradewinds/), hosted by the U.S. Commercial Service, gives U.S. companies the opportunity to explore seven South American markets: Argentina; Bolivia; Chile; Mexico; Paraguay; Peru; and Uruguay. This year, U.S. economic development organizations (EDOs)  will have the opportunity to connect with business leaders, government  officials, and global investors in Santiago, Chile at the Trade Winds-Latin America Business Forum.

EDOs are also welcome to attend optional trade mission stops in the other six markets.
