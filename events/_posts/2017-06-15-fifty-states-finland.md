### "The Fifty States" in Finland

Fourth of July is coming early this year at the U.S. Embassy in Helsinki; on Thursday, June 15, the embassy will host its Independence Day-themed reception - "The Fifty States" - to highlight the country's diversity and the investment opportunities available in the United States. Over 1,000 Finnish government officials and business leaders are expected and U.S. economic development organizations are invited to showcase what their locations have to offer.

_To find out how you can join the event, please contact the [U.S. Commercial Service at the embassy](mailto:office.helsinki@trade.gov)._
