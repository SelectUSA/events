### Berlin Startupnight 2017

On September 8, SelectUSA will be at the fifth edition of [Berlin Startupnight](http://www.startupnight.net/), one of Europe’s largest startup events where new companies present themselves to investors and potential customers. The event attracts over 4,000 participants and more than 250 international startups from various industries. 

Since this year’s partner country is the United States, Chargé d'Affaires Kent Logsdon will deliver opening remarks to highlight the culture of entrepreneurship in both the United States and Europe. In addition to the conference, there will be an exhibition hall where the SelectUSA Germany team will provide participants with information on SelectUSA services, including initial counselling sessions.
