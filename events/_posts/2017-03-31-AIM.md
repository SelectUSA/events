Join SelectUSA and the U.S. Commercial Service in the U.S. Investment Pavilion at the [2017 Annual Investment Meeting (AIM)](http://www.aimcongress.com/en/) in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE) on March 31 - April 4, 2017. Participating economic development organizations will gain unparalleled access to prospective investors from across the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) at this premier event.

#### _Why the GCC?_

As a trading bloc, GCC markets constitute the United States' fifth-largest export market and our fourteenth-largest source of foreign direct investment (FDI), with over $43 billion in FDI as of 2015. In 2014, combined GCC FDI in the United States supported approximately 24,000 U.S. jobs

The UAE is the seventh fastest-growing source of FDI in the United States. With a total stock of $27.4 billion, Emirati FDI directly supports 12,800 U.S. jobs. For more information, check out the [UAE fact sheet](https://www.selectusa.gov/country-fact-sheet/United-Arab-Emirates).

Additionally, the U.S. affiliates of majority Middle Eastern-owned firms spent $1.7 billion on research and development and contributed $3.5 billion to U.S. goods exports in 2014 alone.

#### _Why exhibit in the U.S. Investment Pavilion?_

Since its inception in 2011, AIM has brought together tens of thousands of exhibitors and visitors to network, promote projects and attract investment to their regions. In addition to being featured on a promotional platform hosted by the U.S. government, exhibitors will:

* Secure one-on-one meetings with GCC government and private sector officials with decision-making authority;
* Meet GCC investor delegates recruited by the U.S. Commercial Service;
* Leverage AIM's exclusive networking system to initiate meetings with investors;
* Connect with priority AIM participants at events organized by the U.S. Embassy in Abu Dhabi, the U.S. Consulate in Dubai, and AIM; and
* Receive full assistance from SelectUSA and Commercial Service investment specialists.
