### U.S. Trade & Investment Roundtable in Edinburgh

On September 27, 2017, in Edinburgh, UK, SelectUSA and the U.S. Commercial Service will host a roundtable designed to address questions from companies in the United Kingdom looking to enter or expand in the United States.

Topics include:

* A discussion of the future of the U.S.-UK trade relationship post-Brexit
* Moving from an export to an investment strategy in the United States
* How UK organizations and companies can engage with U.S. cities, states, and regions to grow their relationship with the United States

The event will include insight from: Susan A. Wilson, Principal Officer at U.S. Consulate General Edinburgh; John Simmons, Minister Counsellor for Commercial Affairs at U.S. Embassy London; Liz McAreavey, CEO at Edinburgh Chamber of Commerce; and Duncan McNeill-McCallum, CEO at Vioearth Holdings Ltd.

For more information, including registration, please contact SelectUSA's [Gus Franklyn-Bute](mailto:gus.franklyn-bute@trade.gov) or the Edinburgh Chamber of Commerce's Sophie-Lou Arceselenir](mailto:sophie-lou.arceselenir@edinburghchamber.co.uk).
