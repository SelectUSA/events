Plans for the [2017 SelectUSA Investment Summit](https://www.selectusa.gov/selectusa-summit) (June 18-20, 2017) are well under way and we are excited to share a first look. Our kick-off "Know Before You Go" call will be held **Thursday, December 8, at 1:00 p.m. ET (6:00 p.m. GMT)**.

Call participants will gain information on sponsorship and exhibit opportunities, the Call for Proposals, the events calendar, and more. While this information will be most useful for U.S. economic development organizations, all are welcome!
