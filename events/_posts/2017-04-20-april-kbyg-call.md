With the [SelectUSA Investment Summit](http://www.selectusasummit.us/?utm_source=website&utm_campaign=GrowWithUS17&utm_medium=selectusa) (June 18-20, 2017) only a couple months away, we are excited to share the latest updates with U.S. economic developers interested in attending. The April "Know Before You Go" call will be held **Thursday, April 20, at 1:00 p.m. EDT / 10:00 a.m. PDT**.

Call participants will gain information on sponsorship and exhibit opportunities, and more, including:

* Summit agenda
