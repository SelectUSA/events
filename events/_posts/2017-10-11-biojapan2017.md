### SelectUSA at BioJapan 2017

BioJapan, the top biotechnology industry trade show in Japan, will hold its annual conference on October 11-13, 2017, in Yokohama, Japan. This year's event is expected to bring 900 international organizations from 30 countries together in the Pacifico Yokohama, one of the largest convention centers in the world.

SelectUSA will have a presence in the exhibition hall to meet with business investors and provide information to attendees on SelectUSA services and the U.S. investment climate. U.S. economic development organizations are encouraged to join the SelectUSA team in Japan to promote their locations directly to investors.
