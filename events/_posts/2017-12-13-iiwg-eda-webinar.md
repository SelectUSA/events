### SelectUSA USG Webinar Series: Economic Development and Foreign Direct Investment

The next entry in SelectUSA's **USG (U.S. Government) Webinar series** (which focuses on specific member agencies and programs in the Interagency Investment Working Group, or "IIWG") is set for **December 13, 2017** at **1:00 p.m. ET** / **10:00 a.m. PT** / **6:00 p.m. GMT**.
