### SelectUSA at the 2019 Collision Conference Conference

Are you interested in attracting international business investors at one of the largest tech conferences in North America? SelectUSA will be at the **[Collision Conference](https://collisionconf.com/)** in **Toronto, Canada**, **May 20-22**, and we're looking for U.S. economic development organizations (EDOs) to add to our directory (to be given to and shared with attendees). For **US$75**, SelectUSA will include a brief-but-impactful profile in the EDO directory, including:

* 150-word overview of your location and organization
* Logo
* Contact details for one person
* Website address

Please note that directory space is limited. Entries will be included on a first-come, first-serve basis. EDOs with representatives at the conference will be highlighted. 

For more information, please contact [Bojan Opsenica](mailto:bojan.opsenica@trade.gov).
