### 2017 Northeastern Italy Seminar

SelectUSA and Commercial Service Italy are hosting a series of regional seminars to promote the [2017 SelectUSA Investment Summit](https://www.selectusa.gov/selectusa-summit) and connect Italian investors with U.S. Economic Development Organizations (EDOs). Participants will learn about case studies from Italian companies from each region that have successfully invested in the United States, and EDOs will be able to showcase their locations to Italian investors, network and arrange individual meetings.
