China is both the third fastest-growing and the eleventh-largest overall source of foreign direct investment (FDI) in the United States (_not including Hong Kong_): $58.2 billion. The U.S. subsidiaries of majority Chinese-owned firms directly support 43,800 jobs, contribute $3.5 billion to U.S. goods exports, and spend $545 million on research and development in the United States.
