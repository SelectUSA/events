### SelectUSA at the Fairfax County EDA/techUK Seminar

The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fairfaxcountyeda.org/">Fairfax County Economic Development Authority</a> of Virginia has partnered with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.techuk.org/">techUK</a> to host a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.techuk.org/events/seminar/item/7180-connect-and-grow-in-the-us-through-innovative-security">half-day seminar</a> - titled "Connect and Grow in the U.S. Through Innovative Security" - for cyber security companies, specifically small and medium sized enterprises, on expanding their business into the United States. techUK represents more than 900 UK member companies and technologies, who employ about half of all tech sector jobs in the UK. These companies range from leading FTSE 100 corporations to new innovative start-ups. The seminar will provide insight into how to do business in the complex U.S. market and address key opportunities and challenges for cyber security companies considering their U.S. investment strategy. 

SelectUSA's London specialist, [Gus Franklyn-Bute](mailto:gus.franklynbute@trade.gov?Subject=SelectUSA%20at%20the%20Fairfax%20County/techUK%20Seminar%20-%20Inquiry), will speak at both seminars on the support we can provide to UK firms wanting to enhance their U.S. growth strategy.
